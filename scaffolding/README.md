# Scaffolding

Scaffolding is a big part of Baker. Besides initial application bootstrapping, you can also benefit from generators for  other various parts of your application:

* [Navigation](/scaffolding/navigation.md)
* [Components](/scaffolding/components.md)
* [Containers](/scaffolding/containers.md)
* [Models](/scaffolding/models.md)
* [Sagas](/scaffolding/sagas.md)

## Boilerplates

Component generators come with an additional level of customization through boilerplates. Refer to Component Boilerplates section for more information.
