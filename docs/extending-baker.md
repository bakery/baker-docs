# Extending Baker

One of the guiding design principles in Baker is hackability. **baker** directory contains all the generators used through ```npm run generate``.

**Note**: A bunch of house keeping scripts related to common tasks have been isolated inside [baker-scripts](https://github.com/thebakeryio/baker-scripts) module
