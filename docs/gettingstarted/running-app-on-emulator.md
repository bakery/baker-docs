# Running app on emulator

Baker provides shortcuts for running application on mobile emulators (Android and iOS).

## Running on iOS emulator

```bash
npm run ios
``` 

## Running on Android emulator

```bash
npm run android
```

## Using react-native-cli

Remember that you can always fallback to using **react-native-cli** directly. For example,

```
cd app && react-native run-ios
```
