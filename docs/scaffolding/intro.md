# Scaffolding

Scaffolding is a big part of Baker. Besides initial application bootstrapping, you can also have Baker generate most of the files as your app keeps evolving. "Type less do more thing" starts today! Here are a few things you can scaffold:

* [Components](/scaffolding/components.html)
* [Containers](/scaffolding/containers.html)
* [Models](/scaffolding/models.html)
* [Navigation](/scaffolding/navigation.html)
* [Reducers](/scaffolding/reducers.html)
* [Sagas](/scaffolding/sagas.html)

To access generator interface, run the following command

```
npm run generate
``` 

Baker will list available generator options

```
? Choose the generator to use (Use arrow keys)

## Boilerplates

Component generators come with an additional level of customization through boilerplates. Refer to [Component Boilerplates section](/scaffolding/component-boilerplates.html) for more information.
